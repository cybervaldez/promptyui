# ── Strategy D: Theme Metadata (planned) ──────────────────
# When the meta parser ships, text entries can carry per-value
# reference facts that flow into hook context as ctx['meta'].
# Meta is SEPARATE from annotations — never merged or overridden.
#
# Example (not yet parsed):
#
# text:
#   - content: "Software Engineer"
#     meta:
#       department: "engineering"
#       level: "mid-senior"
#   - content: "Product Manager"
#     meta:
#       department: "product"
#       level: "mid-senior"
#   - "Designer"                    # plain string — no meta (still valid)
#   - content: "Data Scientist"
#     meta:
#       department: "data"
#       requires_degree: true
#   - content: "DevOps Engineer"
#     meta:
#       department: "engineering"
#       level: "mid-senior"
#       infra_access: true
#   - content: "Engineering Manager"
#     meta:
#       department: "engineering"
#       level: "senior-staff"
#       manages_people: true
